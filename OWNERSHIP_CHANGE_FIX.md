# Change of Ownership - JSON Error Fix

## Problem
When trying to add change of ownership records, users encountered the error:
```
Unexpected token '<', " "... is not valid JSON
```

## Root Cause
The `save_ownership.php` API file had an incorrect database connection implementation:
- It was trying to use a `Database` class that doesn't exist
- The actual database configuration uses a `$pdo` variable directly
- This caused a PHP fatal error, which returned HTML error page instead of JSON

## Solution
Fixed the database connection in `backend/api/save_ownership.php`:

### Before (Incorrect):
```php
include_once '../config/database.php';
$database = new Database();
$conn = $database->getConnection();
```

### After (Fixed):
```php
require_once '../config/database.php';
$conn = $pdo;  // Use the $pdo variable from database.php
```

## Changes Made
1. **Fixed database connection**: Changed from non-existent `Database` class to direct `$pdo` usage
2. **Changed include to require_once**: More appropriate for critical dependencies
3. **Maintained all existing validation and error handling**

## Testing Results
- **Before**: Fatal error "Class 'Database' not found" returned as HTML
- **After**: Proper JSON responses for both success and error cases
- **Test successful**: Created ownership change record with ID 1

## API Response Examples

### Success Response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Record saved successfully",
  "id": "1"
}
```

### Error Response (for validation failures):
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Missing required field: co_full_name",
  "data": {...},
  "trace": "..."
}
```

## Impact
- ✅ Change of ownership form now works correctly
- ✅ Proper JSON responses for frontend handling
- ✅ Maintains all existing validation and security features
- ✅ No changes needed to frontend code
