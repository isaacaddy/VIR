# Vehicle Registration Records - Tiles Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API Update (backend/api/vehicle_statistics.php)
- Updated `getRegistrationRecordsStats()` function to provide new statistics:
  - **Total**: All vehicle registrations
  - **Today**: Registrations created today (using CURDATE())
  - **This Week**: Registrations created this week (using YEARWEEK())
  - **This Month**: Registrations created this month (using MONTH() and YEAR())

### 2. Frontend HTML Update (frontend/VehicleRegistrationRecords.html)
- Changed statistics tiles from "Active/Pending" to "Today/This Week":
  - **Tile 1**: Total Registered (unchanged)
  - **Tile 2**: "Active" → "Today" (green color, today icon)
  - **Tile 3**: "Pending" → "This Week" (blue color, date_range icon)
  - **Tile 4**: This Month (changed to purple color for better distinction)

### 3. JavaScript Function Update
- Updated `updateStatistics()` function to:
  - Fetch data from API endpoint with `?type=registration_records`
  - Update correct DOM elements with new IDs:
    - `totalRegistered` (unchanged)
    - `activeCount` → `todayCount`
    - `pendingCount` → `weekCount`
    - `monthlyCount` (unchanged)
  - Include fallback logic for error handling using mock data calculations

### 4. Visual Improvements
- Updated icons for better representation:
  - Today: `today` icon (calendar with today highlight)
  - This Week: `date_range` icon (calendar range)
  - This Month: Changed to purple color scheme for visual distinction

## API Response Format
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "total": "10",
    "today": "10", 
    "week": "10",
    "month": "10"
  }
}
```

## Benefits
1. **More Relevant Metrics**: Shows time-based registration counts instead of status-based
2. **Real-time Data**: Fetches live data from database instead of mock calculations
3. **Better User Experience**: Provides meaningful insights about registration trends
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to calculated values if API fails
5. **Visual Clarity**: Distinct colors and icons for each time period

## Issue Fixed: Date Field Mismatch
**Problem**: Initial implementation used `created_at` field which showed all records as created today, giving inaccurate statistics.

**Solution**: Changed all date queries to use `registration_date` field instead of `created_at` for meaningful time-based statistics.

### Updated Queries:
- **Today**: `WHERE DATE(registration_date) = CURDATE()`
- **This Week**: `WHERE YEARWEEK(registration_date, 1) = YEARWEEK(CURDATE(), 1)`
- **This Month**: `WHERE MONTH(registration_date) = MONTH(CURDATE()) AND YEAR(registration_date) = YEAR(CURDATE())`

## Testing
- API endpoint tested and confirmed working: `http://localhost/VIR/backend/api/vehicle_statistics.php?type=registration_records`
- Returns proper JSON response with all required fields
- Frontend integration completed with proper error handling
- **Verified with test data**: Added test record with today's date, confirmed counts update correctly
- **Sample Response**: `{"status":"success","data":{"total":"11","today":"1","week":"1","month":"1"}}`
